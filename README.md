Motivation 

After 2 years of covid, many Singaporeans, including us, have yearned to travel once more. With many tour guides and tour agencies down, many are left with only google to search up on other countries. However, searching for information to settle their travelling logistics can be very daunting and time-consuming. Hence, creating a very troublesome experience for tourists.    

Most online travel planners now mostly require users to go through the long rigorous process of picking their preferred places of travel/stay from a long list of suggestions with ratings. The troublesome process of having to pick and customise the things they want in their short getaway trip, is something they might not have time for due to busy schedules in their work life.



Project Aim 

We hope to simplify this process by providing users with a selection of fixed itineraries, which they can personalise by checking the things they want. 



User Stories (optional)

As a user of the application, the user will be able to see many different packages for a specific country/city. They can choose which package they want to take up.
After choosing the package, the itinerary of the whole trip is displayed to them and then they have the option to choose which activities they want/do not want to do. After which, they are required to pay a deposit and pay an amount depending on what they chose to do for their trip.
